Installation

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```
2. Create a new Gatsby site with the Portfolio.

   ```sh
   gatsby new portfolio https://github.com/Ren294/portfolio
   ```
3. Once installed, you can begin developing your site.

   ```sh
   cd portfolio
   gatsby develop
   ```
4. By default, the Portfolio has a `content` directory at the root of your Gatsby site. There, you can edit the theme settings as well as add content for your sections.
